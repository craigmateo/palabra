<p>This recent project addresses the need for a simple, lightweight chemistry drawing tool for e-learning.</p>

<p>In collaboration with chemistry instructors, the answer was a Javascript based web application for drawing chemical structures.</p>

<p>Built using Fabric.js the basic functionality includes:</p>

<ul> 
<li>Predefined structures including bonds and rings</li>
<li>Freeform drawing on the canvas</li>
<li>Add text for labels or atoms</li>
<li>Upload image to canvas</li>
</ul>
