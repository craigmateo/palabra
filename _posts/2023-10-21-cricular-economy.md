Ongoing debates about the political and economic power of Big Tech might lead to reforms such as breaking up monopolies. However, thinkers like Weil are a reminder that even grand system changes do not necessarily translate into workplaces that are fulfilling and liberating.

Writing in the context of post-war reconstruction in France, Weil's vision for a society that could overcome oppression and alienation entailed the "dispersion of industrial activity" through small-scale industry, artisanal production, and craftsmanship.

In today's tech economy, such a vision seems so close yet so far away. Tech workers have more flexibility than ever and much knowledge is free and open. Transformative companies can be built by a few people with laptops. At the same time, however, the sector has concentrated wealth to a degree never seen in history, and too many people find themselves in workplaces that leave them burnt out and cynical.

By viewing the current industry in light of past industrial and labor movements and pushing back when possible, tech workers can help build workplaces and artifacts we can be proud of.
