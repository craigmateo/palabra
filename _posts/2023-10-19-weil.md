Tech companies have carefully crafted a progressive image. Recent events -- such as mass layoffs and reports of toxic work cultures -- have brought overdue discussions and critiques of this sector into the mainstream.

We can hope that pushback will lead to a brighter future. But it is difficult to find the language to describe what the modern tech industry even is. Terms like <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/10/what-is-technofeudalism.html" target="_blank">"tecnofeudalism"</a> help explain the big picture role of tech monopolies in the global economy. However, there is also a need to understand and express the day-to-day experiences of workers. 

As a tech worker, I sometimes ask myself: "What if Simone Weil worked in tech?"

## Digital Assembly Lines

In contrast to most intellectuals of the time (and today), Simone Weil has street credibility because in the 1930s she left elite French academia to work in factories in order to experience the situation of workers. 

It began as an attempt to understand why workers did not revolt against their conditions. Weil had romanticized ideas of "a hard but joyous contact with ‘real life’." What she found was a soul crushing fatigue and humiliation that nearly broke her. The suffering was not just physical. What she describes in her journal is a death of thinking where workers are disconnected cogs and "time was an intolerable burden." 

Weil viewed the situation of workers as not being simply about wages. It is also about hierarchical relations and subservience; where people stand in relation to machines, managerial bureaucracies, and systems of production. An alternative to the subordinating, alienating production line is craftsmanship, collaboration, and pride in the product of one's labour.  

If Simone Weil were to work for a modern tech company she would perhaps describe it as a "digital assembly line." She would point out that despite gimmicks like free snacks, the oppressive hierarchies and the production line mentality is pervasive. The technology is often deliberately kept non-transparent and workers are given fragmented tasks without avenues for creativity or development. 

Weil might also point to the unhealthy team dynamics. Based on a recent <a href="https://www.talentlms.com/research/toxic-culture-tech-industry-survey">study</a>, half of all tech workers want to leave their jobs due to toxic workplaces.

## Machines and Craftmanship

Weil foresaw that workers would be cogs under state communism just as they were under capitalism. There are now ongoing debates about the political and economic power of tech. This might even lead to reforms like breaking up monopolies or reforming the current system (of rent seeking techno-feudalism). 

However, the risk is that system change will

determining factor was the relation that existed between man and his work. This relationship was founded in the very nature of reality and an even deeper relation that defined human freedom – the relation between thought and action.

Thus technology is a two-edged sword, possessing the capacity to add to man’s freedom by liberating thought, giving man time to think and to create; or, as in the case of the assembly
