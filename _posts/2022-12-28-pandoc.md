A challenge of maintaining docs-as-code is organizing **stakeholder comments and feedback**. 

It is inconvenient and messy for team members to download a repo and leave comments directly in the markdown. While there are tools for commenting directly in the browser, these can be hit-and-miss. Besides, team members will appreciate using familiar tools rather than introducing new ones. 

A solution is using **Pandoc** to convert markdown to Google docs. This article will show simple shell scripts to bulk convert markdown files for Google Drive.

## Background

### What is docs-as-code?

With <a href="https://docs-as-co.de/" target="_blank">docs-as-code</a>, documentation is managed in the same way as a code. This involves: 

* Writing content with markdown files in an IDE
* Version control system to store and version it
* Automated testing
* Build and deploy system

### What is Pandoc?

The <a href="https://pandoc.org/" target="_blank">Pandoc</a> website describes it as the "swiss-army knife" for converting files from one markup format into another.

It supports conversion to/from dozens of formats: lightweight (e.g., md, emacs); word processor (e.g., docx, RTF); eBooks, TeX, PDF, etc.

It includes a Haskell library and it mostly used as a standalone command-line program. Pandoc is free, released under the GPL.

## Conversion

Bulk converting markdown files to Google Docs simplifies the review process. Of course, one option is simply pulling the markdown directly into Google Drive. However, file conversion is preferable if you want to preserve formatting, images, etc.

The following are steps for converting a directory with subdirectories containing markdown files.

1. Install pandoc: <code>brew install pandoc</code>.
2. Make a copy of the directory you want to convert. <code>cd</code> into that directory (e.g., <code>Documents/docs/</code>).

    <small>*The next 3 steps create separate shell scripts for demonstration. They could also be combined into one.*</small> 

3. If you're markdown contains relative links to images, for conversion you'll need to change the image links to absolute paths. <code>vi convertLinks.sh</code>. 

    In the example below, the images are linked ion the markdown file with the relative path <code>/assets/images/...</code>. The script replaces it with the absolute path <code>/Users/user/Documents/en/assets/images/...</code>.

      <pre>
      #!/bin/bash
      for dir in ~/Documents/docs/*; do
        for sub in /$dir/*.md /$dir/*/*.md; do
        #replace links
        sed -i.bak 's#(/assets/images/#(/Users/user/Documents/en/assets/images/#g' $sub
        done
      done
      </pre>
      <br>


4. For the conversion we can loop through the directories and convert each .md file to the desired format: <code>vi convertFiles.sh</code>. Here, we convert each md file to a new docx with the same name.

      <pre>
      #!/bin/bash
      for dir in ~/Documents/docs/*; do
        for sub in /$dir/*.md /$dir/*/*.md; do
        pandoc $sub -f markdown -t docx -s -o ${sub%.*}.docx
        done
      done
      </pre>
      <br>

5. Finally, delete the .bak and .md files: <code>vi delete.sh</code>. 

      <pre>
      #!/bin/bash
      or dir in ~/Documents/docs/*; do
        for sub in /$dir/* /$dir/*/*; do
        rm ${sub%.*}.bak
        rm ${sub%.*}.docx
        done
      done
      </pre>
      <br>

Running the above scripts:

<code>./convertLinks.sh && ./convert.sh && ./delete.sh</code> 

will result in a directory with only docx files.

## Google Drive

Before moving the folder to Google Drive, make sure you selected the setting "Convert uploaded files to Google Docs editor format". 

<img src="/assets/images/gdrivesettings.webp" alt="convert to Google Drive format" style="margin:auto"/>

Then you can upload your folder and share for commenting.

Once edits have been made, you can use a similar process to convert back to markdown.
