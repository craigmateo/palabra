Our current tech age is, in some ways, analogous to what previous generations faced with industrialization. Narratives of progress through technology were met with labor upheavals, inequality, and alienation. 

In the 19th Century, William Morris responded to the “dark Satanic Mills” of industrialization by calling for social reform and upholding the Medieval idea of craft. To counter tech disenchantment in our own time, we can consider whether Morris’s legacy can inspire today’s digital economy.

## From “The Californian Ideology” to Technofeudalism

When my generation came of age in the 1990s, a common narrative was that computing technologies would drive prosperity, break down old corporate and state power structures, and connect communities. Decades later, critiques of "dotcom neoliberalism" – or what Barbrook and Cameron referred to in their 1995 essay as <a href="https://www.alamut.com/subj/ideologies/pessimism/califIdeo_I.html">"The Californian Ideology"</a> – have a sympathetic ear.  

In a 2020 <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2020/10/15/64-of-americans-say-social-media-have-a-mostly-negative-effect-on-the-way-things-are-going-in-the-u-s-today/">survey</a>, two-thirds of Americans said social media has mostly a negative effect on society. A more recent <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-americans-confidence-in-technology-firms-has-dropped-evidence-from-the-second-wave-of-the-american-institutional-confidence-poll/">study</a> indicates that confidence in technology firms among the public is dropping. This despite an industry propaganda machine that pumps billions into convincing us that tech companies are paragons of progress. (Ad spend by Big Tech reached nearly $50 billion in 2021.)

The notion that tech has led to increased prosperity is questionable. Networking and computing technologies that came largely from public research dollars have been monopolized by private firms that have fuelled the largest wealth inequality in history. Furthermore, there is growing <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/adigaskell/2022/10/20/why-is-technology-not-producing-productivity-improvements/?sh=6b0f78e570e8">evidence</a> that investments in these technologies are not leading to increased productivity. 

The idea that the knowledge economy would lead to more humane and fulfilling workplaces is also being shattered. Recent <a href="https://www.talentlms.com/research/toxic-culture-tech-industry-survey">reports</a> suggest toxic workplaces are the norm in tech.    

Some, like Greek economist Yanis Varoufakis, argue that today’s global economy can not even be described as capitalism. Rather, he argues, we are living under something better described as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/24/yanis-varoufakis-technofeudalism-capitalism-ukraine-interview">technofeudalism</a>.   

## Morris and the ‘Arts and Crafts’ movement

The above critiques are not unfamiliar. The question is how to respond to these economic forces. Morris is someone who responded to troubling economic paradigms of his day through advocacy and writing as well as by designing artifacts.

William Morris (1834 – 1896) was a British textile designer, artist, writer, and activist associated with the Arts and Crafts movement. Along with contemporaries such as John Ruskin, Morris developed a design ethos as a reaction to the modern factory with its division of labor and loss of traditional crafts.
