Our current tech age is, in some ways, analogous to what previous generations faced with industrialization. Like the Industrial Revolution, narratives of progress through technology are met with labor upheavals, inequality, and alienation.

In the 19th Century, William Morris responded to the "dark Satanic Mills" of industrialization by calling for social reform and upholding the medieval idea of craft. To counter tech disenchantment in our own time, we can consider whether Morris's legacy can inspire today's digital economy.

## From “The Californian Ideology” to Technofeudalism

A turn to Morris is motivated by the sense that something is deeply wrong with the economy and society the tech sector is shaping.

When my generation came of age in the 1990s, a common narrative was that computing technologies would drive prosperity, break down old corporate and state power structures, and connect communities. Decades later, critiques of "dotcom neoliberalism" – or what Barbrook and Cameron referred to in their 1995 essay as <a href="https://www.alamut.com/subj/ideologies/pessimism/califIdeo_I.html">"The Californian Ideology"</a> – have a sympathetic ear.

There is growing evidenece that public perceptions of the tech sector are souring. In a 2020 <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2020/10/15/64-of-americans-say-social-media-have-a-mostly-negative-effect-on-the-way-things-are-going-in-the-u-s-today/">survey</a>, two-thirds of Americans said social media has mostly a negative effect on society. A more recent <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-americans-confidence-in-technology-firms-has-dropped-evidence-from-the-second-wave-of-the-american-institutional-confidence-poll/">study</a> indicates that confidence in technology firms among the public is dropping. This despite an industry marketing machine that pumps billions into convincing us that tech companies are paragons of progress. (Ad spend by Big Tech reached nearly $50 billion in 2021.)

The conventional argument that tech has led to increased prosperity is questionable. Networking and computing technologies that came largely from public research dollars have been monopolized by private firms, helping fuel the largest wealth inequality in history. Furthermore, there is growing <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/adigaskell/2022/10/20/why-is-technology-not-producing-productivity-improvements/?sh=6b0f78e570e8">evidence</a> that investments in these technologies are not leading to increased productivity. 

The idea that the knowledge economy would lead to more humane and fulfilling workplaces is also coming undone. Recent <a href="https://www.talentlms.com/research/toxic-culture-tech-industry-survey">reports</a> suggest toxic workplaces are the norm in tech.    

The Industrial Revolution accelerated a sea change from feudalism to capitalism. Some today, like Greek economist Yanis Varoufakis, argue that the global tech economy no longer qualifies as capitalism. Rather, he argues, we have transitioned to something better described as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/24/yanis-varoufakis-technofeudalism-capitalism-ukraine-interview">technofeudalism</a>.

## Morris and the ‘Arts and Crafts’ movement

The question is how to respond to such technological and economic forces. William Morris (1834–1896) is someone who addressed the economic paradigms of his day through advocacy, writing, and <em>designing</em> artifacts.

Morris was a British textile designer, artist, writer, and activist associated with the Arts and Crafts movement. Alongside contemporaries like John Ruskin, Morris developed a design ethos in response to the modern factory system, with its division of labor and the erosion of traditional crafts.

In 1861, Morris founded a company and began making furniture and decorative arts objects commercially. Patterns were based on flora and fauna, inspired by vernacular and rural traditions with an emphasis on affordability and anti-elitism. Products created by Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co. included furniture, metalwork, stained glass, architectural carving and murals.

Later, in 1891 Morris founded the Kelmscott Press which produced works using traditional printing methods and hand-made paper. He also designed distinctive typefaces: Golden, Troy, and Chaucer.

Practitioners of the Arts and Crafts movement did not separate social reform from design reform. Morris saught to use art and design to help rebuild society based on the principles of simplicity and honesty. In contrast to the greed and exploitation of his age, Morris advocated for a simpler, more compassionate society. 

## Implications for the Digital Age

Followers in the Arts and Crafts movement drew parallels between mechanized production of the Industrial Revolution and broader socio-cultural issues of the time. So too can we point to how the digital economy of the Information Age ..
