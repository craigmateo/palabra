<i>Reflections following the PASE 2024 Conference in Warsaw</i>

The theme of this year's PASE (Polish Association for the Study of English) conference was <i>Interspecies Friendships and Non-human Companionships</i>, inspired by Donna Haraway's influential work. Haraway's legacy lies in bridging the organic with the inorganic, the natural with the technological, and the modern with the postmodern, often in unexpected and innovative ways. In this spirit, my contribution experimented with new concepts and methods.

## Bringing posthumanism down-to-earth

Posthumanism ("post" meaning "after" humanism) responds to anthropocentrism in 21st-century thought and the Western philosophical tradition more broadly. The term has come to incorporate broad themes related to more-than-human entanglements. Braidotti (2018), for instance, refers to posthuman condition as the convergence and hybridization of AI, robotics, biogenetics, climate change and the Anthropocene.

Of course, these are sweeping themes. Whether they should be viewed together as a convergence and, if so, how to approach this labyrinth of topics is a conundrum. The concept runs against academic and professional specializations and enclaves. When I first encountered the term "posthuman" it came across as science fiction--perhaps interesting but not helpful in making sense of the 'real' world, and certainly not related to work or day-to-day life.

However, this attitude evolved when seeing how thinkers/storytellers ground the topic in familiar human experiences and relationships. In <i>When Species Meet</i>, Haraway begins with her own firsthand experience with agility training dogs to explore interactions of humans and other species. This provoked me to reflect on my own upbringing on a farm in Canada and agrarian worlds as places of convergence.

## Presentation: "An Ethnographic Reflection on the Limits of Interspecies Friendships"

As part of the track "Posthuman Relations", my presentation attempted to ground the posthuman discussion in a real-life story from my childhood on a farm. The aim was to use this as a basis for exploring the complexities of interspecies relationships in agrarian worlds (Galvin, 2018) given historical and material contexts.

This was my first experimentation with autoethnography as an approach to research that draws on personal experience (auto) to understand cultural experience (ethno). A layered account combined experience with abstract analysis and relevant literature (Ellis, Adams, & Bochner, 2011). This method was much more challenging than I imagined. The difficulty was perhaps partly due to criticisms I've encountered in the past that such approaches are not 'real' scholarship and even self-indulgent.

However, I felt the approach was legitimized with a remark of a participant in another panel that "we" (researchers) are "not transparent to ourselves." This reminded me of Nietzsche's famous assertion "We are unknown to ourselves." Perhaps researchers have an aversion to such approaches precisely because they are going into the unknown.

### Childhood and animals

The account began with memories as a child and encounters with animals in a farm setting. These included a family dog, feral cats and their kittens, wild animals (foxes, deer, birds, and coyotes) as well as 'pests' (such as raccoons and rodents) and, as a focus, the farm animals. My dad kept cattle on the pasture in a process called backgrounding: an intermediate stage between weaning and placement in a feedlot.

The recollections led to the question of how to characterize the various relationships with animals. Were they friends, companions, commodities (in the case of livestock); or were they objects of detached fear or reverence (in the case of wild animals)? To add specificity, I told a story of a particular 'friendship' I had with a calf.

I recall a spring day when I was about 10 years old. A livestock transport truck was unloading a new batch of calves. After the cattle had settled in the barn my dad came out, approached me with a smile and said ''you have a friend in the barn wanting to meet you.'' I ran into the barn and was introduced to a gentle, friendly Hereford calf. I named him Ruttiger. Ruttiger would accompany me as I explored the farm that summer. Whenever he saw me, he would leave the herd to come and say hello, usually with a nudge of his furry head and lick with his big tongue.

The idea of a livestock 'friend' transgresses some socio-cultural norms, which is precisely why I told the story. Normally, this type of friendliness would not take place, but the calf likely came from another farm where children had tamed him. The purpose of the story was not to be cute or nostalgic. Rather, it was meant to juxtapose with realities of global factory farming and frame seemingly abstract topics of the posthuman and Anthropocene as embodied, grounded in lives of humans and other species.

### Humanities and the Anthropocene

Cattle are a species that have become symbolic of colonialism, excess, and the Anthropocene. However, scholarship in the humanities reminds us that things are more layered, complex, and perspective. In a 2019 paper ''Cattle, capital, and colonization'', Rosa Ficek describes how cattle "remake landscapes in ways supportive of capitalist expansion," but can also alter these ecological and human relations in ways that get in the way of expansion or upset the balance of imperial projects. Examples include how cattle enabled consolidation of Indigenous and mestizo resistance, could be a decisive factor in revolutionary wars (Roberts, 2021), and gave rise to frontier areas that challenged reproduction of the colonial social order. Thus within the "terrible" worlds of the colonial cattle industry there remained transformative possibilities for what Ficek calls "multispecies and multiracial living together" (Ficek, 2019).

In search of a philosophy that makes sense of the Anthropocene and the "particular [posthuman] condition we are in", scholar Rosa Braidotti draws attention to Spinoza's rationalism as a method of knowing (2018). Others turn away from the Western tradition towards Indigenous and postcolonial epistemologies.

While my own presentation did not take an explicit stance on these philosophical questions, it did draw attention to humanism as the rediscovery of ancient Greek thought. Specifically it discussed agrarianism as a central tenet in Ancient Greek philosophical thought where agriculture was considered the "most noble of all employments" (Fite, 1967). Agricultural archetypes and rural ideals of the good life have been enshrined in Western thought (Hanson, 1996). Agrarianism as an approach to nature and reaction to the modern techno-scientific era (P. Thompson, 2010) could be seen as being carried through by the Romantics and later the American transcendentalists. Agrarian romanticism is thus an "alternative environmental imagination" within the classical tradition to counter commodification and industrialization (Indriyanto & Angelianawati, 2023). In this tradition we see the etymological roots of 'human' in <i>humus</i> or soil.

Acknowledging the problems inherent to the histories and societies these literatures emerged from, and in Haraway's approach of placing traditions in conversation, I see potential of this philosophical legacy to inform and critique contemporary debates on the posthuman and Anthropocene.

## Conclusion: Re-enchanting (post)nature

In rethinking relationships of humans and other species, we are also rethinking relationships to nature and technology. The meaning of posthumanism has often remained opaque. We have not yet fully recognized its potential for rethinking relationships of "human", "nature" and "technology" in ways that don't reproduce Cartesian dualism or elicit fear of techno-science. In thinking about my childhood and agrarian worlds, I was precisely concerned with avoiding idealization of nature or portraying posthumanism as something unattainable.

My presentation closed with an emphasis that rethinking interspecies friendships and relationships in agrarian worlds reveals limits and possibilities of such relationships and raises new questions and possibilities. It also frames the posthuman condition as one of grappling with convergence, hybridity, and multiple perspectives. Finally, it serves to highlight relevance of this discussion to fields beyond anthropology or critical theory and to reveal how posthumanism can open new spaces in unexpected and successful ways.
