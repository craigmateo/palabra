This project addresses the need for a simple, lightweight chemistry drawing tool for e-learning.

While proprietary drawing tools like <a href="https://perkinelmerinformatics.com/products/research/chemdraw" target="_blank">ChemDraw</a> offer impressive features suitable for the professional chemist, they are often overkill for online learning applications. Integration with e-learning platforms can be both complex and costly.

In collaboration with chemistry instructors, the answer was a Javascript based web application for drawing chemical structures. 

Built using Fabric.js the basic functionality includes:
<!--more-->
* Predefined structures including bonds and rings
* Freeform drawing on the canvas
* Add text for labels or atoms
* Upload image to canvas
