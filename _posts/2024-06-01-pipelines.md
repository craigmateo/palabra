<i>Presentation at Media and Challenges of Modern Society, University of Niš, Serbia</i>

In August 2016, Sioux protesters chained themselves to heavy machinery to block the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAP). In the months that followed, people from across the United States and worldwide saw protesters stand off against militarized police forces and the National Guard. In 2019 and 2020, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) raided protest camps blocking construction of the Coastal GasLink Pipeline (CGP) crossing Wet’suwet’en First Nation territory in British Columbia. 

DAP and CGP are examples of the thousands of ongoing conflicts between communities and extractive/energy industries (EJatlas, 2022; Temper et al., 2020). This study aims to better understand these debates and thereby enhance intercultural and intergroup communication.

## Method: Cognitive Discourse Analysis 

A challenge in understanding these conflicts is the complex themes at play: cultural, social, economic, ecological, etc. To better understand these debates, we can investigate whether differing cognitive structures and mental representations are reflected in pro- and anti- sides of pipeline debates and, if so, how. To do this in the present study, a method called cognitive discourse analysis (CODA) was used. In plain language: what people say (discourse) reflects how they think (cognition). By looking closely at what people say, we can understand how they think about a topic. The aim is to improve communication in the context of these projects by understanding what's important to different groups of speakers, their concerns and assumptions, how they frame the topic, etc. 

## Data 

The present study uses data from two web corpora containing quotations related to the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAP) and Coastal GasLink Pipeline (CGP). The aim was to obtain empirical, natural language verbalisations from a wide variety of speakers. 

Quotations were then extracted with context (500L, 500R) using regular expression matching on quotation marks found in media articles. The result, after curation, was 194 quotations in context (91 from DAP corpus and 103 from CGP).

Quotes from proponents (i.e., quotes made in the context of advocating for the pipeline or denouncing the protesters) were put into group A. Group B was assigned quotes from pipeline opponents/protesters. The quotes were listed with
a code, text, speaker, and group as follows:

## Analysis

Analysis was based on Tenbrink's (2020) three aspects of CODA analysis: (i) Cognitive orientation; (ii) Cognitive depth; and (iii) Cognitive constructiveness. Here, we'll briefly look at the following elements of the analysis: 

- <b>Themes</b> the speakers were concerned with.
- <b>Identities</b> speakers used to refer to themselves or other groups.
- <b>Geographic Scale</b>, or whether the speakers saw these pipelines in a local, national, or global context.
- <b>Metaphors</b> that speakers used in reference to the pipeline.

### Themes

The question of what these debates are really ‘about’, as determined by what topics speakers focus on, was the starting point for analysis.

It was determined that quotes could be assigned one of three categories representing the main theme of the quote: (i) technical-scientific; (ii) socio-economic; and (iii) historical-cultural. “Techno-scientific” quotes focused on environmental impacts, safety, or technical aspects of the infrastructure (e.g., DAP013 below). “Socio-economic” quotes encompassed interactions between protestors, communities, and executive branches of government (e.g., CGP038) as well as grievances related to social/economic inequality and institutional discrimination. The label “historical-cultural” was applied to quotes that expressed cultural identity, values, and ways of life (e.g., CGP077) as well as historical Indigenous relations.

<img src="/assets/images/quotes2.jpg" alt="">

Assigning categories in this way, most quotations (113 quotes or 58 percent) concerned socio-economic themes, followed by historical-cultural (60 quotes or 31 percent). Only 21 quotes (11 percent) were technical-scientific.

</table>

Among group A quotations, the techno-scientific theme had a somewhat higher percentage than in B, but still only at 16 percent overall. The technical-scientific category was even lower (7 percent) among group B. The vast majority (75 percent) of group A quotes are socio-economic in nature, often where speakers were expressing the economic advantages of the project or reacting to protestors. Notably, only 9 percent of group A quotes were historical-cultural, in contrast to 46 percent from group B.

Common themes in group B were marginalisation (19 quotes), negative health outcomes (16), racism (18), discrimination (19), and inequality (20). In Group B, speakers also assert group identities based on social bonds (25), shared history and culture (30).

### Identities

In addition to themes revealing what speakers are attending to, language used by speakers reveals their conceptual perspective or point of view. This might encompass, for instance, worldviews, beliefs, or concepts that are closely related to identity. To examine perspective, the analysis considered how group identities were expressed by speakers. Of interest were cultural indicators such as group membership, pronoun usage, or other linguistic markers of identity. In statements from group B, pronouns “we” or “our” are used to assert Indigenous/First Nations cultural identity. This is demonstrated in the examples (DAP50-CGP69) below.

<img src="/assets/images/quotes3.jpg" alt="">

By contrast, in group A “we” is more likely to be used to refer to a company (e.g., DAP011), agricultural producers (e.g., CGP064), or body politic (e.g., DAP013). Interestingly, in group A, “we” is used rhetorically to invoke a collective, though the precise group is ambiguous. For instance, in CGP004 below, “we” and “our” could be interpreted as referring to Canadian citizens, but this is not explicit.

<img src="/assets/images/quotes4.jpg" alt="">

### Geographic Scale

A pipeline can be approached at different temporal and geographic scales. For instance, geographically, one might view a pipeline as physically corresponding to the material steel construction and the lands and waters that it transverses. However, the view might also take into consideration areas of primary extraction through subsurface drilling and hydraulic fracturing. Still too, one could account for other aspects of the supply chain through shipping and destination markets. Environmental impacts through emissions or contamination can likewise be conceptualised at multiple local and global geophysical scales.

To consider scale, the quotes were analysed for geographic language. For each quote deemed to contain geographic language (referring explicitly or implicitly to a territory, political jurisdiction, or space), a geographic scale (regional, state, global) was assigned. “Regional” refers to community, traditional territory, or locality (e.g., CGP067). “State” refers to the federal nation state (i.e., US, Canada) as well as member states and provinces (e.g., North Dakota, British Columbia) as in DAP021. “Global” refers to the international political context or the planet as a global environmental frame (e.g., DAP064).

<img src="/assets/images/quotes5.jpg" alt="">

Of the 70 quotes with geographic references, 36 were regional, 28 national, and 6 global. Among the geographic quotes in each group, group B had a higher percentage of regional (52 vs. 38 percent in A) and group A had a higher percentage of national (63 vs. 35 percent in B). All of the global quotes were in group B.

### Identity Construction

The quotations were analysed to determine how group identities were constructed through the discourse as a whole.

In group A, we find statements that have the effect of othering or defining a person or group in a negative way that creates distance and difference (Powell, 2020). Rather than referring to the protesters as identifiable people, they are generalised as “protesters” (e.g., DAP001, DAP003 below) or “groups” (DAP015). Even though the protest camps were established by local First Nations, statements by pipeline proponents scarcely mention these communities. In fact, phrases such as “diaspora” (DAP014) or “outside groups” (DAP015) create the image of geographically dispersed individuals with no local ties or history. Protesters are characterized as “unlawful” (DAP001, GCP039) or “illegal” (CGP061), “aggressive” (DAP003), “violent” (DAP017), “confrontational” (DAP017), ‘frightening” (DAP019), and “dangerous” (CGP061). These adjectives disassociate protesters from the society or body politic that is constructed in proponent discourse.

<img src="/assets/images/quotes6.jpg" alt="">


### Metaphor

Metaphors were identified in the quotes as expressions of conceptual schema implicit in the groups of speakers. In line with critical metaphor analysis (Charteris-Black, 2004), attention was given to the discursive role played by metaphors. The metaphor analysis is therefore concerned not only with metaphor use to understand how the speaker thinks about the pipeline, but also the rhetorical effect the metaphors have on readers and audiences.

Group A quotations invoke several conceptualizations identified in previous metaphor research, such as change as motion (Garrido, 2011), the state as body (Musolff, 2016), and political notions of “home” as security (Marks, 2019). For example, the DAP as a <i>step forward</i> (DAP010) maps onto the source domain of embodied movement. The movement forward is for a complete body-polity ‘America’ (as opposed to certain interest groups). Notably, the movement forward is a steady and gradual ‘step’ as opposed to a leap or drive. It is measured and controlled. Meanwhile, the pipeline opposition was framed as a subgroup of opponents preventing this forward movement through “delays” and “disruptions” (e.g., DAP005, DAP006).

Likewise, the <i>light at the end of the tunnel</i> metaphor (CGP003) to refer to CGP construction reflects the idea of the pipeline as forward movement. As in the DAP discourse, getting <i>back on track</i> (CGP064) is consistent with the broader motif of protestors preventing forward movement.

<img src="/assets/images/quotes7.jpg" alt="">

The subject of the <i>step forward</i> metaphor is energy security. The subject of <i>light at the end of the tunnel</i> is economic activity (or the natural gas “game”) and getting <i>back on track</i> refers to grain transport after protestors blocked railways. Along with forward movement, 14 group A quotations combine references to security and safety with respect to energy, the economy, and nation state. In group B, the notion of <i>coming to a head</i> (CGP088 below) is consistent with the forward movement frame, but with the implication that the movement will reach a point of crisis rather than security (as in group A).

Other metaphors and uses of figurative language in group B break with the conceptual frames of the forward movement and security. The common metaphor of earth as mother (CGP088) invokes a cluster of attributes that is on a conceptual domain quite different from group A. The same could be said with respect to the image of <i>caretakers</i> of the land (CGP069). Figurative language that brings together complex associations is the pipeline as <i>black snake</i> (DAP073). This refers to the Lakota prophecy of a creature (Zuzeca Sape) that would bring sorrow and destruction and, when it makes its way underground, would destroy the world (López, 2019; Stern, 2018).

Taking Malan’s (2016) thesis of myth as metaphor, we can view the invocation of this
prophecy as a conceptual mapping and blending, activating otherwise distant interpretations and
meanings (Petrilli, 2006). The black snake creates diffuse associations between the pipeline,
colonial history, cultural tradition, global environmental catastrophe, and modern technology.

## Conclusion

The analysis provides methodologies and insights that can enhance understanding of dynamics of pipelines or other discourses related to natural resources and infrastructure. However, further study with larger datasets would be needed for conclusions to be generalisable.
 
Of interest is how--by turning to myth, symbolism, and cultural modes--quotations in group B break with framings of group A. Stanojević and Šarić (2019) point to the role of metaphors as framing devices that “contribute to the construction of sameness and difference” through interaction with “symbols and myths, cultural models, and stereotypes” (1). Group B re-frames the discourse around “cultural keywords” (Levisen & Waters, 2017) and thus reflects a different conceptual schema. While metaphors in groups A are unconscious, rather conventional utterances in American English, those in B are a conscious break from the script. 

Baudemann (2016) describes how deliberate language use in Indigenous literature liberates readers from colonial identities and blends traditions in a “conscious choice to evoke and subvert the dominant discourse” (173). In a similar manner, the <i>black snake</i> metaphor subverts the discursive construction of the pipeline as a technology of progress that can be managed through modern scientific expertise.

Effective intercultural and intergroup communication in these debates could be advanced by understanding cognitive frames being unconsciously used as well as conscious subversions of the dominant frames. In the data, there was a legitimacy exchange taking place within relatively consistent cognitive frames (for instance, the socio-economic statements in groups A and B). Simultaneously, in group B there was a conscious subversion of the dominant framing through culturally affirmative language and conceptual blending.
